# AWS-Ansible
##
In my repository, there is a skeleton for creating a simple infrastructure based on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The playbook can be executed from the main playbook.yml file, which serves as the starting point for setting up the infrastructure. This skeleton includes all the necessary components and configurations required to get started with using AWS, making it an ideal starting point for those looking to build a simple infrastructure on the platform. To run use main file [mainplaybook](https://github.com/dkasyan/AWS-Ansible/blob/main/mainplaybook.yml)
